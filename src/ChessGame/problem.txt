Design Chessboard:

1. Represent an 8x8 grid with alternating light and dark squares.
2. Place pieces in their standard initial positions.

# Player Interaction:
1. Support two players: White and Black.
2. White always makes the first move.
3. Players alternate turns to move their pieces.

# Piece Movement:
1. Implement movement rules for each type of chess piece (e.g., Pawn, Rook, Knight, Bishop, Queen, King).

# Move Validation:
1. Ensure moves are valid according to chess rules.
2. Prevent illegal moves, such as placing one's own king in check.

# Turn Management:
1. Enforce alternate turns between players.
2. Indicate whose turn it is.

# Optional Features:
1. Undo and redo moves.
2. Save and load game progress.
